		<h1>Hello World: My Name is Claira</h1>
		<p id=houseplants> My name is Claira and my partner's name is Vinson. We are students in the art 101 class. We both enjoy houseplants. I'm an art major with a minor in art hisroy and visual culture. Vinson is a film and digital media major. He will be graduting this Spring and I will be graduating in the future. We are doing fine so far and haven't had a mental breakdown due to this class... yet. We also both like cheese. </p>

	<h2>Fun Facts!!!</h2>
	<p id=cheese> - Did you know that when a hermit crab comes across a new shell, they try the new shell on and if it doesn't fit they wait until another crab has tried the new shell on and it fits? But if it doesn't fit that crab it waits too. So the crabs will wait until a crab bigger enough for the shell can fit and then all the crabs switch shells so they all get a new home. That's pretty neat. </p>
<p id=scooter> - Did you know pickles are just cucumbers? Well they are. </p>
	<p id=four> - Did you that crocodiles cannot stick their tongues out? So they can't go :p it's sad really. </p>
