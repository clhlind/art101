	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p id=sun>The point of this lab was to create a complete local file structure, add index.html files and upload it to the server.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p id=hi>My partner and I both faced challenges when trying to upload our images into our index.htmls, however we couldn't figure out why my images wouldn't fully download on the website. Other than that we did everything else with ease.</p>
