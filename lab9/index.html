		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p id=wu>I've been sick for a week now and I haven't gotten any better, <br>
      so its been a little difficult to not be able to work side to side with my partner. <br>
      We also had problems with the JS because we were both on the zoom lecture and Wes <br>
      never shared their screen, so we were kinda lost on most of the process.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="d">
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p id=nm>This is the result of my JavaScript functions, my CSS file, and HTML index.<br>
      Go to the console to see the output!!!</p>
