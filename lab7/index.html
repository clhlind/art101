		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p id=hi>For this lab the challenges included; working with a partner to problem solve amd to write functions <br>
      that take user input and manipulate a string, which seems a little scary.</p>
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p id=wu>One problemt that I had with this lab was just the fact that functions confused me, <br>
      but luckily my partner was there to help explain it to me.</p>
		<h4>Results</h4>
		<p id=nm>This is the result of my JavaScript functions, my CSS file, and HTML index.<br>
      The username is at the bottom:)</p>
